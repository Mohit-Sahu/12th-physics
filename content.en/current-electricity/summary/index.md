# SUMMARY


- The current, I flowing in a conductor \\(I=\frac{d Q}{d t}\\), where \\(d Q\\) is the charge that flows through a cross-section in a time interval dt. SI unit of current is ampere (A). \\(1 \mathrm{~A}=1 \mathrm{C} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\\).

- The current density $J$ in a conductor is the current flowing per unit area. \\(\left(J=\frac{I}{A}\right)\\)

-  Current is a scalar but current density is a vector.

- The general form of Ohm's law \\(\vec{J}=\sigma \vec{E}\\)


- Practical form of Ohm's law states that \\(V \propto I, or V=I R\\) where *I* is the current and *R* is the resistance, *V* potential difference between ends of the conductor.

- The resistance *R* of a conductor is \\(R=\frac{V}{I}\\). SI unit of resistance is ohm \\((\Omega)\\) and \\(1 \Omega=\frac{1 V}{1 A}\\)

- The resistance of a conductor \\(R=\rho \frac{l}{A}\\) where l is length of the conductor and *A* is its area of cross section.

- The resistivity of a material determines how much resistance it offers to the flow of current.

- The equivalent resistance \\(\left(R_{S}\right)\\) of several resistances \\(\left(R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3} \ldots \ldots ..\right)\\) connected in series is \\(R_{S}=\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3} \ldots \ldots ..\right)\\)

- The equivalent resistance \\(\left(R_{P}\right)\\) of several resistances \\(\left(R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3} \ldots \ldots ..\right)\\) connected in parallel is \\(\frac{1}{R_{p}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\ldots \ldots\\)

- Kirchhoff's first rule (Current rule or junction rule): The algebraic sum of the currents at any junction is zero.

- Kirchhoff's second rule (Voltage rule or loop rule): In a closed circuit the algebraic sum of the products of the current and resistance of each part of the circuit is equal to the total emf included in the circuit.

- Electric power is the rate at which electric energy is delivered.

- If a current *I* flows across a potential difference *V*, the power delivered to the circuit is *P=I V*.

- In a resistor R, the electrical power converted to heat is \\(P=I^{2} R=\frac{V^{2}}{R}\\)

- The energy equivalent of one kilowatt-hour \\((\mathrm{kWh})\\) is \\(1 \mathrm{kWh}=3.6 \mathrm{X} 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}\\).

- Metre bridge is one form of Wheatstone's network.

- Potentiometer is used to compare emf of cells.

- Joule's law of heating is H=V I t (or) \\(H=I^{2} R t\\).
