**NUCLEI**

**Introduction** In the previous section, we have

discussed about various preliminary atom models, Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment and Bohr atom model. These played a vital role to understand the structure of the atom and the nucleus. In this section, the structure of the nuclei and their properties, classifications are discussed.

### Composition of nucleus

Atoms have a nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. The neutrons are electrically neutral (_q_ \= 0) and the protons have positive charge (_q_ \= + _e_) equal in magnitude to the charge of the electron (_q_ \= –_e_). **The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number** and it is denoted by _Z_**.** The number of neutrons in the nucleus is called neutron number **(_N_). The total number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus is called the mass number** and it is denoted by _A_. Hence, _A_ = _Z_+_N_**.**

The two constituents of nucleus namely neutrons and protons, are collectively called as nucleons. The mass of a proton is 1 6726 10 27. × − kg which is roughly 1836 times the mass of the electron. The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than the mass of the proton and it is equal to 1 6749 10 27. × − kg.

To specify the nucleus of any element, we use the following general notation

_Z AX_

where _X_ is the chemical symbol of the element, _A_ is the mass number and _Z_ is the atomic number. For example, the

**9.4**

| 6,7,8..... |Pfund |
  

nitrogen nucleus is represented by 7

15_N_ . It implies that nitrogen nucleus contains 15 nucleons of which 7 are protons (_Z_ \= 7) and 8 are neutrons (_N_ \= _A_ – _Z_ \= 8). Note that once the element is specified, the value of _Z_ is known and subscript _Z_ is sometimes omitted. For example, nitrogen nucleus is simply denoted as 15_N_ and we call it as ‘nitrogen fifteen’.

Since the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons, the overall charge of the nucleus is positive and it has the value +_Ze_. But the atom is electrically neutral which implies that the number of electrons in the atom is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus.

### Isotopes, isobars, and isotones

**Isotopes:** In nature, there are atoms of a particular

element whose nuclei have same number of protons but different number of neutrons. These kinds of atoms are called isotopes. In other words, **isotopes are atoms of the same element having same atomic number _Z_, but different mass number _A_**. For example, hydrogen has three isotopes and they are represented as 1

1_H_ (hydrogen), 1

2_H_ (deuterium),and 1

3_H_ (tritium). Note that all the three nuclei have one proton and, hydrogen has no neutron, deuterium has 1 neutron and tritium has 2 neutrons.

The number of isotopes for the particular element and their relative abundances (percentage) vary with each element. For example, carbon has four main isotopes:

6

11_C_ , 6

12_C_ , 6

13_C_ and 6

14_C_ . But in nature, the percentage of

6

12_C_ is approximately 98.9%, that of 6

13_C_ is 1.1% and that of

6

14_C_ is 0.0001%. The other carbon isotope

6

11_C_ , does not occur naturally  

and it can be produced only in nuclear reactions in the laboratory or by cosmic rays.

Since the chemical properties of any atom are determined only by electrons, the isotopes of any element have same electronic structure and same chemical properties. So the isotopes of the same element are placed in the same location in the periodic table.

**Isobars: Isobars are the atoms of different**

**elements having the same mass number _A_, but different atomic number _Z_**. In other words, isobars are the atoms of different chemical elements which have same number of nucleons. For example

16

40_S_ , 17

40_Cl_ , 18

40 _Ar_ , 19

40_K_ and 20

40_Ca_ are isobars having same mass number 40 but different atomic numbers. Unlike isotopes, isobars are chemically different elements. They have different physical and chemical properties.

**Isotones: Isotones are the atoms of different**

**elements having same number of neutrons**. 5

12_B_ and 6

13_C_ are examples of isotones with 7 neutrons each.

### Atomic and nuclear masses

The mass of nuclei is very small (about 10-25 kg or less). Therefore, it is more convenient to express it in terms of another unit namely, the _atomic mass unit (u)._ **One atomic mass unit (_u_) is defined as the (1/12)th of the mass of the isotope of carbon**

6

12_C_ which is more abundant in naturally occurring isotope of carbon**.**

In terms of this atomic mass unit, the mass of the neutron = 1.008665 _u_, the mass of the proton =1.007276 _u_, the mass of the hydrogen atom = 1.007825 _u_ and the mass of 6

12 12_C u_\= . Note that usually mass specified is the mass of the atom, not mass of the nucleus. To get the nuclear mass of particular nucleus, the mass of electrons has to be subtracted from the corresponding atomic mass. Experimentally the atomic mass is determined by the instrument called Bainbridge mass spectrometer. If we determine the atomic mass of the element without considering the effect of its isotopes, we get the mass averaged over different isotopes weighted by their abundances.

**EXAMPLE 9.6**

Calculate the average atomic mass of chlorine if no distinction is made between its different isotopes?

**_Solution_**

The element chlorine is a mixture of 75.77% of 17

35_Cl_ and 24.23% of 17 37_Cl_ . So the

average atomic mass will be

In fact, the chemist uses the average atomic mass or simply called chemical atomic weight (35.453 u for chlorine) of an element. So it must be remembered that the atomic mass which is mentioned in the periodic table is basically averaged atomic mass.

### Size and density of the nucleus

The alpha particle scattering experiment and many other measurements using  

different methods have been carried out on the nuclei of various atoms. The nuclei of atoms are found to be approximately spherical in shape. It is experimentally found that radius of nuclei for _Z_ > 10, satisfies the following empirical formula

_R R A_\= 0

1 3 (9.19)

Here _A_ is the mass number of the nucleus and the constant R0 = 1.2 F, where 1 F = 1 × 10–15 m.The unit fermi (F) is named after Enrico Fermi.

**EXAMPLE 9.7**

Calculate the radius of 79 197 _Au_ nucleus.

**_Solution_**

According to the equation (9.19),

_R m_\= × × = ×− −1 2 10 197 6 97 1015 1 3 15. ( ) .

Or _R =_ 6.97 F

**EXAMPLE 9.8**

Calculate the density of the nucleus with mass number _A_.

**_Solution_**

From equation (9.19), the radius of the

nuclecus, R = _R A_0

By ignoring the mass difference between the proton and neutron, the total mass of the nucleus having mass number _A_ is equal to _A.m_ where _m_ is mass of the proton and is equal to 1.6726 x 10-27 kg.

The above expression shows that the nuclear density is independent of the mass number _A_. In other words, all the nuclei (_Z_ > 10) have the same density and it is an important characteristic property of all nuclei.

We can calculate the numerical value of this density by substituting the corresponding values.

It implies that nucleons are extremely tightly packed or compressed state in the nucleus and compare this density with the density of water which is 103 kg m-3.

A single teaspoon of nuclear matter would weigh about trillion tons.

### Mass defect and binding energy

It is experimentally found out that the mass of any nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its individual constituent particles. For example, consider the carbon-12 nucleus which is made up of 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Mass of 6 neutrons = 6 1 00866 6 05196× =. ._u u_ Mass of 6 protons = 6 1 00727 6 04362× =. ._u u_  

Mass of 6 electrons = 6 0 00055 0 0033× =. ._u u_

The expected mass of carbon-12 nucleus = 6 05196 6 04362 12 09558. . ._u u u_\+ =

But using mass spectroscopy, the atomic mass of carbon-12 atom is found to be 12 _u_. So if we subtract the mass of 6 electrons (0.0033 _u_) from 12 _u_, we get the nuclear mass of carbon-12 atom which is equal to 11.9967 _u_. Hence the experimental mass of carbon-12 nucleus is less than the total mass of its individual constituents by ∆_m u_\= 0 09888. . This difference in mass ∆_m_ is called mass defect. In general, if M, mp,

and mn are mass of the nucleus ( _Z AX_ ), the

mass of a proton and the mass of a neutron respectively, then the mass defect is given by

∆_m Zm Nm Mp n_\= +( ) − (9.20)

Where has this mass disappeared? The answer was provided by Albert Einstein with the help of famous mass-energy relation ( )_E mc_\= 2 . According to this relation, the mass can be converted into energy and energy can be converted into mass. In the case of the carbon-12 nucleus, when 6 protons and 6 neutrons combine to form carbon-12 nucleus, mass equal to mass defect disappears and an energy equivalent to missing mass. This energy is called the binding energy of the nucleus (BE) and is equal to ∆_m c_( ) 2 . In fact, to separate the carbon-12 nucleus into individual constituents, we must supply the energy equal to binding energy of the nucleus.

We can write the equation (9.20) in terms of binding energy

_BE Zm Nm M cp n_\= + −( ) 2 (9.21)

It is always convenient to work with the mass of the atom rather than with the mass of

the nucleus. Hence by adding and subtracting the mass of the _Z_ electrons, we get

_BE Zm Zm Nm M Zm cp e n e_\= + + − −( ) 2 (9.22)

_BE Z m m Nm M Zm cp e n e_\= +( ) + − −  2

where _m m mp e H_\+ = (mass of hydrogen atom)

Here _M Zm Me A_\+ = where _M A_ is the mass of the atom of an element _Z_

_AX_ . Finally, the binding energy in terms of

the atomic masses is given by

_BE Zm Nm M cH n A_\= + −\[ \] 2 (9.24)

![Avg. binding energy of the nucleons](9.24.png "")

Important inferences from of the average binding energy curve:

(1) The value of _BE_ rises as the mass number increases until it reaches a maximum value of 8.8 MeV for A = 56 (iron) and then it slowly decreases.

(2) The average binding energy per nucleon is about 8.5 MeV for nuclei having mass number lying between A = 40 and 120. These elements are comparatively more stable and not radioactive.

| He32H21 |
  

(3) For higher mass numbers, the curve drops slowly and _BE_ for uranium is about 7.6 MeV. Such nuclei are unstable and exhibit radioactive.

From Figure 9.24, if two light nuclei with A<28 combine with a nucleus with A<56, the binding energy per nucleon is more for final nucleus than initial nuclei. Thus, if the lighter elements combine to produce a nucleus of medium value A, a large amount of energy will be released. This is the basis of nuclear fusion and is the principle of the hydrogen bomb.

(4) If a nucleus of heavy element is split (fission) into two or more nuclei of medium value A, the energy released would again be large. The atom bomb is based on this principle and huge energy of atom bombs comes from this fission when it is uncontrolled. Fission is explained in the section 9.7
