# types of spectrum emission and sbsorption spectrum-fraunhofer lines

When an object burns, it emits radiations. That is, it emits electromagnetic radiation which depends on temperature. If the object becomes hot, it glows in red colour. If the temperature of the object is further increased, then it glows in reddish- orange colour and becomes white when it is hottest. The spectrum in Figure 5.11 usually

![Black body radiation spectrum – variation with temperature](5.11.png "")

is called black body spectrum (Refer XI Physics Unit 8). It is a continuous frequency (or wavelength) curve depending on the body’s temperature.

Suppose we allow a beam of white light to pass through the prism (as shown in Figure 5.12). It is split into its seven constituent colours which can be viewed on the screen as continuous spectrum. This phenomenon is known as dispersion of light and the definite pattern of colours obtained on the screen after dispersion is called as spectrum. The spectra can be broadly classified into two catagories:

![White light passed through prism – dispersion](5.12.png "")
**Figure 5.12** White light passed through prism – dispersion

**(a)Emission spectra** When the spectrum of self luminous
source is taken, we get emission spectrum. Each source has its own characteristic

![continuous emission spectra](5.13.png "")
**Figure 5.13**  *continuous emission spectra*

![line emission spectra](5.14.png "")
**Figure 5.14** *line emission spectra* 

emission spectrum. The emission spectrum can be divided into three types:

**(i) Continuous emission spectrum (or continuous spectrum)** 
If the light from incandescent lamp (filament bulb) is allowed to pass through prism (simplest spectroscope), it splits up into seven colours. Thus, it consists of wavelengths containing all the visible colours ranging from violet to red (Figure 5.13). Examples: spectrum obtained from carbon arc and incandescent solids.

**(ii) Line emission spectrum (or line spectrum):**

Suppose light from hot gas is allowed to pass through prism, line spectrum is observed (Figure 5.14). Line spectra are also known as discontinuous spectra. The line spectra consists of sharp lines of definite wavelengths or frequencies. Such spectra arise due to excited atoms of elements. These lines are the characteristics of the element and are different for different elements. Examples: spectra of atomic hydrogen, helium, etc.

**(iii) Band emission spectrum (or band spectrum)**

Band spectrum consists of several number of very closely spaced spectral lines which overlap together forming specific bands which are separated by dark spaces. This spectrum has a sharp edge at one end and fades out at the other end. Such spectra arise when the molecules are excited. Band spectrum is the characteristic of the molecule and hence the structure of the molecules can be studied using their band spectra. Example: spectra of ammonia gas in the discharge tube etc.

**(b) Absorption spectrum** 

**When light is allowed to pass through a medium or an absorbing substance then the spectrum obtained is known as absorption spectrum.** It is the characteristic of absorbing substance. Absorption spectrum is classified into three types:

**(i) Continuous absorption spectrum**
When we pass white light through a blue glass plate, it absorbs all the colours except blue and gives continuous absorption spectrum.

![line absorption spectra](5.15.png "")
**Figure 5.15** *line absorption spectra*

**Fraunhofer lines**
When the spectrum obtained from the Sun is examined, it consists of large 
number of dark lines (line absorption spectrum). These dark lines in the solar spectrum are 

![Solar spectrum - Fraunhofer line](5.16.png "")
**Figure 5.16** Solar spectrum - Fraunhofer lines 
 
known as Fraunhofer lines (Figure 5.16). The absorption spectra for various materials are compared with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum, which helps in identifying elements present in the Sun’s atmosphere.

**(ii) Line absorption spectrum**

When light from the incandescent lamp is passed through cold gas (medium), the spectrum obtained through the dispersion due to prism is line absorption spectrum (Figure 5.15). Similarly, if the light from the carbon arc is made to pass through sodium vapour, a continuous spectrum of carbon arc with two dark lines in the yellow region are obtained.

**(iii) Band absorption spectrum**

When white light is passed through the iodine vapour, dark bands on continuous bright background is obtained. This type of band is also obtained when white light is passed through diluted solution of blood or chlorophyll or through certain solutions of organic and inorganic compounds.

**SUMMARY**

- Maxwell modified Ampere's law as
![Alt text](image-49.png "w-50 float end")

- An electromagnetic wave is radiated by an accelerated charge which propagates 
through space as coupled electric and magnetic fields, oscillating perpendicular to 
each other and to the direction of propagation of the wave.

- Electromagnetic waves are non-mechanical and do not require any medium for propagation.

- The instantaneous magnitude of the electric and magnetic field vectors in 
electromagnetic wave are related by {{<katex>}}c = {\frac{E}{B}}{{</katex>}}.

- Electromagnetic waves can show interference, diffraction and also can be polarized
 
- Electromagnetic waves carry not only energy and momentum but also angular 
momentum. 

- Types of spectra: emission and absorption spectra.
 
- When the spectrum of self luminous source is taken, we get emission spectrum. Each 
source has its own characteristic emission spectrum. The emission spectrum can be divided into three types: continuous, line and band.
 
- When the spectrum obtained from the Sun is examined, it consists of a large number of dark lines (line absorption spectrum). These dark lines in the solar spectrum are known as Fraunhofer lines.
