## LORENTZ FORCE

When an electric charge _q_ is kept at rest in a magnetic field, no force acts on it. At the same time, if the charge moves in the magnetic field, it experiences a force. This force is different from Coulomb force, studied in unit 1. This force is known as magnetic force. It is given by the equation

_F q B_\= ×( )_v_ (3.54)

In general, if the charge is moving in both the electric and magnetic fields, the total force experienced by the charge is given by

_F q E B_\= + ×( )_v_ . It is known as Lorentz force.
