**SUMMARY**

1. The axis aligned with the geographic meridian is called the geographic meridian, while the one aligned with the magnetic field is called the magnetic meridian.

2. The angle between the magnetic field and the horizontal plane is called magnetic dip or magnetic inclination. It is denoted by {{< katex >}}  \theta {{< /katex >}} .

3. The magnetic induction ({{< katex >}}  \mathbf{B} {{< /katex >}} ) is a vector quantity denoted by {{< katex >}}  \mathbf{B} {{< /katex >}} . Its unit is Tesla (T).

4. Magnetic dipole moment ({{< katex >}}  \mathbf{pm} {{< /katex >}} ) is the product of the pole strength and magnetic length. It is denoted by {{< katex >}}  \mathbf{pm} {{</ katex >}} .

5. A magnetic pole of strength unity experiences a force of 1 Tesla.

6. Magnetic flux ({{< katex >}}  \Phi_B {{< /katex >}} ) is the product of the magnetic induction and the area perpendicular to the field. Its unit is Weber (Wb).

7. Coulomb's inverse law states that the force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

8. Torque is experienced by a magnetic field, and a moving coil galvanometer is used to measure small currents.

10. Three categories of magnetism are diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic.

11. Hysteresis refers to the cyclic variation in the magnetizing field.

12. Ampère’s circuital law is {{< katex >}}  \oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu \mathbf{I}_{\text{enclosed}} {{< /katex >}} .

17. Fleming’s Left Hand Rule: Stretch forefinger, middle finger, and thumb of the left hand such that they are in mutually perpendicular directions. If the forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field, the middle finger in the direction of electric current, then the thumb points in the direction of the force experienced by the conductors.
