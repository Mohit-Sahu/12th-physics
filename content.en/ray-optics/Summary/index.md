# SUMMARY
 
- A ray of light gives the direction of light.
- Law of reflection is, _i=r_
- Paraxial rays are the rays travelling close to the principal axis of the mirror and make
- small angles with it.
- The relation between focal length and radius of curvature in spherical mirror is, {{<katex>}}2 f=R \quad{{</katex>}} (or) {{<katex>}}\quad \mathrm{f}=\frac{R}{2}{{</katex>}}
- Cartesian sign conventions are to be followed to trace image formed by spherical mirrors.
- The mirror equation is, {{<katex>}}\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}{{</katex>}}
- The magnification in spherical mirror is, {{<katex>}}m=\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}=-\frac{v}{u}, m=\frac{h^{\prime}}{h}=\frac{f-v}{f}=\frac{f}{f-u}{{</katex>}}
- Light travels with lesser velocity in optically denser medium.
- Refractive index is the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to speed of light in medium, {{<katex>}}n=\frac{c}{v}{{</katex>}}
- Optical path is the equivalent path travelled in vacuum in the same time light travels through a optically denser medium. {{<katex>}}\quad d^{\prime}=n d{{</katex>}}
- Law of refraction also called as Snell's law in ratio form is, {{<katex>}}\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}${{</katex>}}.
- In product form is, {{<katex>}}n_{1} \sin i=n_{2} \sin r{{</katex>}}
- The relative refractive index of second medium with respect to first medium is, {{<katex>}}n_{21}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}{{</katex>}}
- The apparent depth is always lesser than actual depth. The equation for apparent depth is, {{<katex>}}d^{\prime}=\frac{d}{n}{{</katex>}}
- The critical angle of incidence {{<katex>}}i_{c}{{</katex>}} for a ray incident from a denser to rarer medium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is {{<katex>}}90^{\circ}{{</katex>}}. For {{<katex>}}i>i_{c}{{</katex>}}, total internal reflection occurs.

- The refractive index of prism depends on angle of prism and angle of minimum deviation given by the equation, {{<katex>}}n=\frac{\sin \left(\frac{A+D}{2}\right)}{\sin \left(\frac{A}{2}\right)}{{</katex>}}
- When white light travels through a medium, different colours travel with different speeds leading to dispersion of light. Red colour travels faster than violet colour in a medium. In vacuum all the colours travel with the same speed.
- The angle of deviation produced by the small angled prism is, {{<katex>}}\delta=(n-1) A{{</katex>}}
